I was born in Chicago. I did my BS and MS at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I did my PhD at Duke University. All three degrees are in computer science, but I am a mathematician!

Currently, my research sits at the intersection of pure and applied algebraic topology, algebraic combinatorics (Rota's way), and category theory. I like to use category theory to organize my thoughts and ask precise questions.

I help run [CSU Topology Seminar](https://sites.google.com/view/csu-applied-topology/home).
