I was born in Chicago and spent most of my childhood in the city and then in Niles, a nearby suburb. I did my BS and MS at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. After some industry experience, I decided I was more interested in theory and philosophy than engineering. I went back to school earning my PhD at Duke University. All my degrees are in computer science, but I am a mathematician.

My research sits at the intersection of pure and applied topology, algebraic combinatorics (Rota's way), and category theory. I like to use category theory to organize my thoughts and 
ask precise questions.
