  abstract = {We develop a cohomological approach to M\"obius inversion using derived functors in the enriched categorical setting. For a poset \(P\) and a closed symmetric monoidal abelian category \(\mathcal{C}\), we define M\"obius cohomology as the derived functors of an enriched hom functor on the category of \(P\)-modules. We prove that the Euler characteristic of our cohomology theory recovers the classical M\"obius inversion, providing a natural categorification. As a key application, we prove a categorical version of Rota's Galois Connection. Our approach unifies classical ideas from combinatorics with homological algebra.},

	Abstract = {We build a functorial pipeline for persistent homology. The input to this pipeline is a filtered simplicial complex indexed by any finite metric lattice, and the output is a persistence diagram defined as the M{\"o}bius inversion of its birth-death function. We adapt the Reeb graph edit distance to each of our categories and prove that both functors in our pipeline are 1-Lipschitz, making our pipeline stable. Our constructions generalize the classical persistence diagram, and in this setting, the bottleneck distance is strongly equivalent to the edit distance.},

On one side of the equivalence is the category of cosheaves that are constructible with respect to a locally cone-like stratification. Our constructibility condition is new and only requires that certain inclusions of open sets are sent to isomorphisms. On the other side of the equivalence is the category of functors from the entrance path category, which has points for objects and certain homotopy classes of paths for morphisms. When our constructible cosheaves are valued in Set we prove an additional equivalence with the category of stratified coverings.}

The direct definition in the 2-parameter setting, and the corresponding brute-force algorithm to compute them, require$\Omega(n^4)$ operations, where $n$ is the complexity of the input. But the size of the generalized persistence diagram, $C$, can be as low as linear (and as high as cubic).  We elucidate a connection between the 2-parameter and the ordinary 1-parameter settings, which allows us to design an output-sensitive algorithm, whose running time is in $O(n^2 m + Cm)$, where $m$ is the number of simplices in the input.}

  abstract={This paper introduces M\"obius homology, a homology theory for representations of finite posets into abelian categories. While the connection between poset topology and M\"obius functions is classical, we establish a direct connection between poset topology and M\"obius inversions. More precisely, the M\"obius homology categorifies the M\"obius inversion because its Euler characteristic is equal to the M\"obius inversion of the dimension function of the representation. We also introduce a homological version of Rota's Galois Connection Theorem which relates the M\"obius homology over two posets connected by a Galois connection. Our main application is to persistent homology over general posets. We show that under one definition,  the persistence diagram is an Euler characteristic over a poset of intervals and hence M\"obius homology is a categorification of the persistence diagram. This provides a new invariant for persistent homology over general posets. Finally, we  use our homological Rota's Galois Connection Theorem to prove several results about the persistence diagram.}
