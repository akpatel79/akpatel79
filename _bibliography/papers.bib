  abstract={When persistence diagrams are formalized as the M\"obius inversion of the birth--death function, they naturally generalize to the multi-parameter setting and enjoy many of the key properties, such as stability, that we expect in applications.  The direct definition in the 2-parameter setting, and the corresponding brute-force algorithm to compute them, require$\Omega(n^4)$ operations, where $n$ is the complexity of the input. But the size of the generalized persistence diagram, $C$, can be as low as linear (and as high as cubic).  We elucidate a connection between the 2-parameter and the ordinary 1-parameter settings, which allows us to design an output-sensitive algorithm, whose running time is in $O(n^2 m + Cm)$, where $m$ is the number of simplices in the input.}

  abstract={We dualize previous work on generalized persistence diagrams for filtrations to cofiltrations. When the underlying space is a manifold, we express this duality as a Poincaré duality between their generalized persistence diagrams. A heavy emphasis is placed on the recent discovery of functoriality of the generalized persistence diagram and its connection to Rota's Galois Connection Theorem.}

  abstract={We employ the recent discovery of functoriality for persistent homology to recast the Persistent Homology Transform of a geometric complex as a cosheaf of combinatorial persistence diagrams. Detailed examples are provided. We hope the recasting of the PH transform as a cellular cosheaf will allow for the adoption of existing methods from category theory and (co)sheaf theory to the study of shapes.}

  abstract={This paper introduces M\"obius homology, a homology theory for representations of finite posets into abelian categories. While the connection between poset topology and M\"obius functions is classical, we establish a direct connection between poset topology and M\"obius inversions. More precisely, the M\"obius homology categorifies the M\"obius inversion because its Euler characteristic is equal to the M\"obius inversion of the dimension function of the representation. We also introduce a homological version of Rota's Galois Connection Theorem which relates the M\"obius homology over two posets connected by a Galois connection. Our main application is to persistent homology over general posets. We show that under one definition,  the persistence diagram is an Euler characteristic over a poset of intervals and hence M\"obius homology is a categorification of the persistence diagram. This provides a new invariant for persistent homology over general posets. Finally, we  use our homological Rota's Galois Connection Theorem to prove several results about the persistence diagram.}

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
